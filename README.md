# Mobile-Health-clinics-MHCs-
We will develop an AI model trained with the previous 10 years' data on several serious diseases.


-This would be installed in our MHCs application.


-Whenever a patient(user) feels something unusual symptoms in his/her body. As an instant guide, the patient will input the symptoms in our AI model and based on the past 10 years of data, our AI model will produce a comprehensive output based on the data available.


-Except for the AI model, the patient would be able to monitor all other health data like heart rate, Blood pressure, body weight, body temperature, etc.



FURTHER EXPANSION OF THE IDEA
-Fully Equipped Medical facilities on wheels.


-Travelling to remote villages and communities.


-Provides essential healthcare services.


-MHC would have healthcare professionals.


FEATURES


-Accessibility


-Affordability


-Preventive Care


-Technology Integration


-The AI model would be installed in our MHCs also.


-The MHCs would still have professionals to tackle those diseases for which an instant solution can be provided and handled then and there.
